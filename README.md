# Libraries

This repository contains shared library code for the node-based services.


### Setting Up Local npm Storage And Instructions How To Debug node shared libraries

To be able to debug any of this library that exists in node repository, follow instructions on [THIS LINK](https://sera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/78381332/How+To+Debug+shared+Node+libraries).

The same principle can be used on any other project/repository that uses libraries from other repositories as an npm package.


### Shared Library Node Update Process:

## Installation  

To use this shared library in your microservice, install it via npm:

```sh
npm install node-shared-libraries
```

---

## Listening to Events  

Microservices can listen to AWS EventBridge events using the `EventBridgeListener` from this library.  
Below is an example of how to set up event listeners in your service:

```javascript
import { EventBridgeListener } from "node-shared-libraries/dist/index.js"; 
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

const eventBridgeListener = new EventBridgeListener();

// Register one or more handlers
eventBridgeListener.registerHandler("MembershipCreated", (event) => {
  console.log("Handling MembershipCreated event:", event.detail);
  // Process the event data...
});

// Register additional event handlers as needed
// eventBridgeListener.registerHandler("AnotherEvent", handlerFunction);

// Attach the listener router to handle incoming events
app.use("/webhook", eventBridgeListener.router);

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Microservice listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

---

## Event Handling  

- Events sent via AWS EventBridge will be received at `/webhook`.  
- Each microservice can register event handlers for specific event types.  
- Unregistered events will be ignored.
